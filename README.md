                                               FLAPPY BIRD

## DESCRIPTION

'Flappy Bird' is a casual game in which the player controls a cute bird through obstacles after obstacles.
The bird controlled by the player will automatically fly forward, and the player can control the height of the bird's flight. After the bird flies over the obstacle, it will add points, but it cannot touch the obstacle or the ground. Once it touches the obstacle or the ground, the game will fail.

## HOW TO PLAY

Click the left mouse button or press the space key to increase the flying height of the bird.

## GAMEFEATURES

During the flight of the bird, it will fall due to gravity. The player can increase the flying height of the bird by clicking the mouse or pressing the space key. The height of the raising will be determined according to the time of pressing the mouse(or pressing the space key), so it is necessary to master a certain rhythm. The difficulty of the game is great, waiting for your challenge. You can get four different medals in this game – the bronze, silver, gold, and platinum.

Getting the bronze medal is fairly easy (relatively speaking), as it only requires you to earn a total of ten points. You can do this by luck, but you’ll have to start finding a good rhythm and knowing how to position your bird for a good jump through pipes.

The silver medal really begins to require concentration. You’re not going to just get this one with luck, as it requires twenty points. 

The gold medal requires you to earn a total of thirty points. By the time you pass twenty, your heart rate will probably begin to increase, so you have to put extra focus into maintaining your concentration and keeping your rhythm. 

The platinum medal requires 40 points, which can prove to be next to impossible to get to unless you’re really good at this game. Your heart will be pounding as you pass thirty, and your vision possibly blurring due to intense concentration, so remember to RELAX, and remember to actually blink.
